        <h3>Where do you get your pizza from?</h3>
        <p>We use <a href="http://slicelife.com/">SliceLife</a> to find pizza places close to the lines since
            they let us tip and don't require someone to sign on delivery. We like to go with the local spots
            as much as possible.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>What if there are funds left over?</h3>
        <p>Every dollar collected will go towards feeding hungry Americans. Any funds not spent will be saved
            for future hungry voters and/or marchers.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>I have more questions?</h3>
        <p>That's more of a statement - but why don't you send them to us at <a href="mailto:morequestions@polls.pizza">morequestions@polls.pizza</a></p>

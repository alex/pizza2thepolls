            <h3>Is this a charity?</h3>
            <p>No, so contributions are not tax-deductible. (But we are an official 501(c)(4) nonprofit, if you're a tax
                code nerd like that).</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Who do you give pizzas to?</h3>
            <p>We send pizzas anywhere there's a line and ask our delivery people to give them to anyone there: people in
                line, their kids, poll volunteers and staff, and anyone else hungry for a slice.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>So is this partisan?</h3>
            <p>No. Ain't nothing partisan about trying to make voting less of a drag.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Where do you get your pizza from?</h3>
            <p>We use <a href="http://slicelife.com/">SliceLife</a> to find pizza places close to the lines since they let
                us tip and don't require someone to sign on delivery. We like to go with the local spots as much as
                possible.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>What if there are funds left over?</h3>
            <p>Every dollar collected will go towards feeding hungry Americans. Any funds not spent will be saved for
                future hungry voters and/or marchers.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>I have more questions?</h3>
            <p>That's more of a statement - but why don't you send them to us at <a href="mailto:morequestions@polls.pizza">morequestions@polls.pizza</a></p>
